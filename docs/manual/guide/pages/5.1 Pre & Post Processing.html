    Sometimes it's necessary to do something before or after your fixture is loaded. You can do this by adding <code>pre</code> and/or <code>post</code> handler in your fixture files.<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>pre &#123;
  /&#42; <span class="java&#45;keyword">do</span> things before loading fixture &#42;/
&#125;<p class="paragraph"/>fixture &#123;
  /&#42; fixture definition &#42;/
&#125;<p class="paragraph"/>post &#123;
  /&#42; <span class="java&#45;keyword">do</span> things after loading fixture &#42;/
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>All beans in your application (and any parent fixtures, see <a href="../guide/single.html#5.2 Stacking" class="guide">stacking</a>) are available in both pre and post processors...<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>pre &#123;
  someService.someMethod()
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>Additionally, any object loaded in the fixture is available in the <em class="italic">post</em> processor by name...<p class="paragraph"/><div class="code"><pre>fixture &#123;
  log(LogMessage) &#123;
    message = <span class="java&#45;quote">"something happened"</span>
  &#125;
&#125;
post &#123;
  // change the creation date of the log message
  log.dateCreated &#45;= 1
  log.save()
&#125;</pre></div><p class="paragraph"/>Pre process handlers are executed as soon as they are encountered. However, post processors are <strong class="bold">not</strong> executed until all fixtures have been loaded (e.g. load patterns that match multiple files or fixtures with includes).
