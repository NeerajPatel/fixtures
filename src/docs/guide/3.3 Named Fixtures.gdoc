Sometimes you want to have the fixture object that you load stick around. For this you can use "named fixtures"...

{code}
// load it and name it 'myFixture'
fixtureLoader['myFixture'].load('someFixtureFile')
// access it
fixtureLoader['myFixture'].someObjectFromTheFixture
{code}

Property access notation also worksâ€¦

{code}
// load it and name it 'myFixture'
fixtureLoader.myFixture.load('someFixtureFile')
// access it
fixtureLoader.myFixture.someObjectFromTheFixture
{code}
