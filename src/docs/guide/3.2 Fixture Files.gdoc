You can load fixtured from a file by passing the file name to the @load(String)@ method of the @fixtureLoader@ bean.

{code}
def fixture = fixtureLoader.load("gina")
{code}

You can load multiple fixtures at once by passing more than one fixture file name...

{code}
def fixture = fixtureLoader.load("gina", "otherfixture")
{code}

Beans in different fixture files can reference each other. As long as the necessary fixtures are loaded, the references will resolve.


h4. Loading via patterns

Ant style path patterns are supportedâ€¦

{code}
fixtureLoader.load("books/*")
{code}

h4. Integration Tests

The fixtures plugin creates a bean called @fixtureLoader@ in your grails app which you can use to load fixtures.

{code}
class GinaTests extends GroovyTestCase {
	def fixtureLoader

	void TestIt() {
		fixtureLoader.load("gina")
		def gina = Book.findByTitle("Groovy In Action")
		assertNotNull(gina)
		assertEquals(2, gina.authors.size())
	}
}
{code}
